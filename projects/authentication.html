			<li><strong>(Oakland'19) Why Does Your Data Leak? Uncovering the Data Leakage in Cloud From Mobile Apps</strong></li>
		
			This project seeks to understand data leaks in mobile backend as a service (mBaaS) due to lack of authentication, misuse of various authentication keys, and misconfiguration of user permissions in authorization.<br><br>
			
			<li><strong>(ACSAC'18) <a href="../papers/acsac18a.pdf">A Measurement Study of Authentication Rate-Limiting Mechanisms of Modern Websites</a></strong></li>
			This project conducts a measurement study of such countermeasures against online password cracking. Towards this end, we propose a black-box approach to modeling and validating the websites' implementation of the rate-limiting mechanisms. We applied the tool to examine all 182 websites that we were able to analyze in the Alexa Top 500 websites in the United States. <br><br>
		
			<li><strong>(NDSS'18) <a href="../papers/ndss18b.pdf">Face Flashing: A Secure Liveness Detection Protocol based on Light Reflections</a></strong></li>
				
				Liveness detection is an important technique for defending face authentication systems against media-based facial forgery attacks. This paper proposes a new liveness detection protocol called Face Flashing: by randomly flashing well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces to detect real human faces. <br><br>
			
			<li><strong>(CCS'10) <a href="../papers/ccs10.pdf">The Security of Modern Password Expiration: An Algorithmic Framework and Empirical Analysis</a></strong></li>
				In this project, we conducted the first large-scale study of the success of password expiration in meeting its intended purpose, namely revoking access to an account by an attacker who has captured the account's password.<br><br>
